# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Course-Project
The repo contain the script and 'UCI HAR Dataset' folder with data sets.
Download the repo and than run the script to get two tidy datasets:
1) X - the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement
2) X_AVG - the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
